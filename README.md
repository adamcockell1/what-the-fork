# What The Fork

[What The Fork](https://adamcockell1.github.io/what-the-fork/)

The intention behind this project is to create a striking visual web experience using javascript animations and effects and responsive design. More or less a tech demo/testing grounds for learning Javascript.

## Known Issues

-   When the `filters` tag contains `invert() grayscale()` and either filter is removed, the transition effect does not happen. To recreate: toggle lightmode, then grayscale, then back to darkmode (or vice versa).
-   Splash screen icon translation to navbar does not dynamically adjust to different window dimensions. To recreate: resize the viewport while the scroll translation is happening.
